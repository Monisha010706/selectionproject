JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive content on web pages. It allows developers to manipulate elements, handle events, and manage data within a web browser. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of JavaScript:<br>

<h2>1. Data types</h2>
JavaScript supports various data types including:<br>

Primitive types: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol.<br>
Complex types: object (arrays, functions, objects), function.<br>

<h3>Client-side:</h3> It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.<br>
<h3>Server-side:</h3> It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.<br>

<h3>Imperative language:</h3> In this type of language we are mostly concerned about how it is to be done. It simply controls the flow of computation. The procedural programming approach, object, oriented approach comes under this as async await we are thinking about what is to be done further after the async call.<br>
<h3>Declarative programming:</h3> In this type of language we are concerned about how it is to be done, basically here logical computation requires. Her main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it as the arrow function does.<br>

<h2>How to Link JavaScript File in HTML ?</h2>
JavaScript can be added to HTML file in two ways:

Internal JS: We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the script tag <br>
External JS: We can write JavaScript code in another files having an extension.js and then link this file inside the <head> tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.<br>
